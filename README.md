This Java program implements a simple calculator using the Swing GUI toolkit. It creates a graphical interface with buttons for digits, arithmetic operators, and other functions. The calculator GUI includes a text field for displaying input and results, numeric buttons (0-9), operator buttons (+, -, *, /), and additional buttons for decimal point(,), equals sign(=), delete(<-), and clear(C). The program uses action listeners to handle button clicks, updating the text field based on user input. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The layout and appearance are defined using Java's JFrame, JTextField, JButton, and JPanel components, with specific button positions, sizes, and colors. The calculator supports continuous calculations by storing previous results and updating the display accordingly. If there are any mistakes made, please let me know. Have fun!
